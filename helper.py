start_text = '''This bot is for downloading any anime direclty via links in multiple quality
                
Use /help to know commands and how to use this bot'''

help_text = '''List of commands:
/anime <name of anime you want> : to download any anime by search

/latest : to get list of latest episodes released

/batch <animeid>:<from episode>:<to episode> : For getting download links in bulk

/download : same as batch download but you get 1 file you can import in **1DM** (here the highest possible resolution is provided so if you want to choose resolution use old batch command)

/manga <name of manga you want> : Get information mainly manga id here

/read <copy this command from the manga infromation and add chapter number> : Open provided file in chrome to read

/source : You can see the source code and more information of the bot if u want
 
                
The links provided are in multiple qualities to download just open links in chrome and download starts automatically
                
**(HDP-mp4)** links can be direclty opened in VLC or MX player to stream episodes without downloading

**MixdropSV** links usually have lowest size for 720p
                
I suggest open the links in **1DM** app on playstore instead of chrome for easy downloading
