Use /help to know commands and how to use this bot'''

help_text = '''List of commands:

/batch <animeid>:<from episode>:<to episode> : For getting download links in bulk

/source : You can see the source code and more information of the bot if u want
                
                
The links provided are in multiple qualities to download just open links in chrome and download starts automatically
                
**(HDP-mp4)** links can be direclty opened in VLC or MX player to stream episodes without downloading

**MixdropSV** links usually have lowest size for 720p
                
I suggest open the links in **1DM** app on playstore instead of chrome for easy downloading
